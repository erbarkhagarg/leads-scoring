# leads-scoring
This assignment is about assigning a score to each candidate, who visits the website, which will be indicative of how likely is the customer going to convert to a paying customer<br>
The model was built in Python based on the dataset available<br>
To solve the problem, a Logistics Regression model was built, that predicts the lead score for each of the candidates<br>
An optimal cust-off probability was defined visualizing the Precision - Recall tradeoff graph<br>
A Lead score over the cut-off probability indicates the candidate will turn into a paying customer, otherwise not.<br>
